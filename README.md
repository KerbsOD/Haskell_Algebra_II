# Haskell Algebra II

## About 
We had a complementary class in Algebra II were we did programs with Haskell and Recursion.

## Files
- Each ***Class_XX*** equals a class were we learn Haskell and we did little programs.   
- In the ***Practical Exams*** folder there are 2 programs that were our evaluation tests, these were a group exam were the program needed to be precise. At the end of each exam, this was corrected via bots to satisfy a number of cases. When the exam was approved, we had a meeting with a proffesor of the computer science department to explain the problematic and our solution.
